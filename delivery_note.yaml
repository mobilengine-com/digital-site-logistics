    ## Introduction
    
    The Delivery Note API is a REST API for creating delivery notes, getting a printable QR code for a delivery note and checking the status of the created delivery note.

    The Products API supports querying and creating products used in delivery notes.

    ## Security
    Access to the API is only allowed when the request contains an API key.
    The API key must be sent in the HTTP Authorization header, with the Bearer authentication scheme:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer MyApiKey123
    ```

    Requests without an API key or with an invalid API key will result in a HTTP 401 error code.

    There are no fine-grained access rights, every API key allows clients to execute read and write operations through the API.

    The API is only accessible through HTTPS.

    ## Getting an API key
    Administering API keys is done via the BauApp web interface.

    The sandbox server accepts any API key that matches the regex `[0-9a-f]{32}`.

    ## Message format
    The API consumes and produces JSON messages, with the exception of the QR code endpoint, which returns an image.

    The encoding of the JSON messages must be UTF-8.

    Date fields are formatted like `2020-12-31` according to OpenAPI specs.
    Datetime values are formatted like `2020-12-31T23:59:59Z` for UTC datetimes, and `2020-12-31T23:59:59+02:00` for datetimes with an offset.

    See [http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#data-types](http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#data-types) for the specification details.

    ## Main use case
    The main use case for the API is to
    1. Create a delivery note, by sending a POST message to the `/delivery_notes` path.
    2. Get the QR code for the delivery note. For this, get the QR code PNG from `/delivery_notes/{id}/qr_code`.
    3. Use the QR code somewhere on your physical delivery note document.
    4. Poll the delivery note path for status changes. The status field of the delivery note is updated shortly 
      after the QR code is scanned by the recipient of the delivery. Currently there isn't any other way to be 
      notified of status changes to the delivery note (no webhooks or updates through websockets).
    5. Download the delivery receipt PDF from from `/delivery_notes/{id}/receipt`.

    ## Updating delivery notes
    The API doesn't allow updating delivery notes after creation.

    You should just create a new note if a created note contains an error.

    ## Data retention
    For now, the production server keeps delivery notes indefinitely.

    The data on the sandbox server is removed periodically.

    ## Rate limiting
    Rate limiting is based on the provided API key.
    If too many requests are sent in a period of time the server responds with HTTP 429 messages.

    Explicit rate limit values are to be determined later.

    Rate limits on the sandbox server may be stricter than on the production server.

    ## Request size
    The request body size of create (POST) operations is limited. See each create operation for the exact size limits.
